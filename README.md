Hi!!

I write some funny and useful scripts for roblox and upload them right here!

How do i make that?
- I write the main script logic, UI (if there is even UI lol), and everything myself, and it is 100% handwritten.
- Then i let AI polish my script to
	→ Clean bugs
	→ Optimize perfomance
	→ Make the code cleaner (i'm not sure about ts 💀💀)

In result my scripts are stable and fast (probably bro idk 😩😩)
